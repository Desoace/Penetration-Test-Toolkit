The Penetration Testing Toolkit represents a comprehensive suite of offensive security tools integrated into a single modular framework. This sophisticated toolkit combines multiple attack vectors and reconnaissance capabilities that security professionals use during authorized penetration tests. The port scanner module implements multi-threaded TCP scanning to rapidly identify open ports across target systems, featuring service detection through banner grabbing and intelligent port prioritization for common services. The scanner can identify over 20 common services and attempts to retrieve service banners for version identification. The brute force module supports multiple protocols including SSH using the Paramiko library, FTP using Python's built-in ftplib, and HTTP form-based authentication. It implements intelligent session management, error handling for connection issues, and supports custom wordlists for password attacks. The network sniffer module, requiring administrative privileges and the Scapy library, captures and analyzes network packets in real-time, identifying protocols, source and destination addresses, and port information. The vulnerability scanner module performs multiple security checks including SSL/TLS configuration analysis to identify weak protocols and ciphers, common file and directory discovery to find exposed sensitive files, and optional integration with Nmap for comprehensive vulnerability assessment. The exploit generator module provides ready-to-use payloads including reverse shells in multiple languages such as Bash, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Netcat, and PowerShell, plus web shell templates for PHP, ASP, and JSP. The toolkit features an intuitive interactive menu system with color-coded output for clarity, comprehensive error handling, and detailed logging. All findings are compiled into JSON reports containing timestamps, discovered vulnerabilities, and successful exploitation attempts. The modular architecture allows easy extension with new attack modules while maintaining clean separation of concerns. Threading implementation ensures optimal performance during scanning operations, while safety features include rate limiting and timeout handling. This toolkit serves as both an educational resource for understanding attack methodologies and a practical tool for authorized security assessments.
